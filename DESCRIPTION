Description: This package contains all functions to calculate root reinforcement 
    according to the Wu/Waldron model (WWM), fibre bundle models with discrete
    root diameter classes (FBM, FBMw) and fibre bundle models with continuous,
    power-law root distributions (FBMc, FBMcw). All functions are provided both
    with added Weibull survival functions (added 'w') or not. A R Shiny application
    is included.
