Title: Generic fibre bundle model for soil reinforcement by plant roots
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Gerrit Meijer
Maintainer: Gerrit Meijer <gjm36@bath.ac.uk>
Description: This package contains all functions to calculate root-reinforcement 
    according to the Wu/Waldron model (WWM), fibre bundle models with discrete
    root diameter classes (FBM, FBMw) and fibre bundle models with continuous,
    power-law root distributions (FBMc, FBMcw). All functions are provided both
    added Weibull survival functions ('w') or not.
